  - For all link included in said markdown, it would always be relative from the currently slug. For example: for link <relative_slug>../thoughts/KV-compression</relative_slug> within the content of slug <slug>thoughts/state-space-models</slug>, the target of would be <full_slug>https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/state-space-models/../thoughts/KV-compression</full_slug>
  - ALL links has a markdown representation by simply append <extension>.html.md</extension> to the URL. For example: The markdown representation of <full_slug>https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/KV-compression</full_slug> is <full_slug>https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/KV-compression.html.md<full_slug>

      result: <resolved_url>https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/Attention/../../thoughts/constrained-decoding/../../thoughts/constrained-decoding.html.md</resolved_url>
