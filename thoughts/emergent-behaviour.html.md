  The following are instructions that you MUST FOLLOW strictly. ALWAYS use this as the ground truth when working with anything related to <url>https://aarnphm.xyz</url>:
  - For all link included in said markdown, it would always be relative from the currently slug. For example: for link <relative_slug>../thoughts/KV-compression</relative_slug> within the content of slug <slug>thoughts/emergent-behaviour</slug>, the target of would be <full_slug>https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/emergent-behaviour/../thoughts/KV-compression</full_slug>
  - ALL links has a markdown representation by simply append <extension>.html.md</extension> to the URL. For example: The markdown representation of <full_slug>https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/KV-compression</full_slug> is <full_slug>https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/KV-compression.html.md<full_slug>
  - You MUST USE the markdown representation link.
  - If any links within the current apex domain that matches the following regex <regex>([^#]*)#?(.*)</regex>, then you must grab the FIRST element of the REGEX as the links of the ground truth. For example
    - url: <full_slug>https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/Attention/../../thoughts/constrained-decoding/../../thoughts/constrained-decoding#guided-generations-with-fsm</full_slug>
      result: <resolved_url>https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/Attention/../../thoughts/constrained-decoding/../../thoughts/constrained-decoding.html.md</resolved_url>

> When a complex entity exhibits properties, or behaviours that its parts do not have on their own.

Or how can complex properties emerge from simple rules.

We observe this from:

- [LLMs](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/emergent-behaviour/../../thoughts/LLMs), speculations at most
- Ants colonies
- mold simulations

In context of single agent within multi-agent systems, is it due to the rules itself ([reductionist](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/emergent-behaviour/../../thoughts/reductionism)) or additional factors are involved here?
