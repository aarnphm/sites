  The following are instructions that you MUST FOLLOW strictly. ALWAYS use this as the ground truth when working with anything related to <url>https://aarnphm.xyz</url>:
  - For all link included in said markdown, it would always be relative from the currently slug. For example: for link <relative_slug>../thoughts/KV-compression</relative_slug> within the content of slug <slug>thoughts/lenses</slug>, the target of would be <full_slug>https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/lenses/../thoughts/KV-compression</full_slug>
