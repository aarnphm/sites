Positive reinforcement (praise, rewards) strengthens the behaviour and increases the likelihood of it being repeated, where as negative reinforcement ensures such behaviour are not being repeated.

### critique.

- one-dimensional to understand human-behaviour, as it focuses only on observable behaviours and neglects internal mental processes
- deterministic, as it assumes that behaviour is determined by the environment and not by the individual, which induces [confirmation bias](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/Behavirourism/../../thoughts/confirmation-bias)
- [Compression](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/Behavirourism/../../thoughts/Compression) problems
