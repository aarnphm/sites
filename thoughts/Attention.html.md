([Vaswani et al., 2023](#bib-vaswani2023attentionneed))

Attention operates on a sequence of query $Q$, key $K$ and value $V$ vector. Attention matrix of a sequence then computed as:

$$
A(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}(\frac{Q \cdot K^{T}}{\sqrt{d}})V \space \space \text{ for } Q_{L \times d}, K_{L \times d}, V_{L \times d}
$$

## Muti-head Attention

Allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions:

$$
\begin{aligned} \text{MHA}(Q,K,V) &= \text{concat}(\text{head}_1, \cdots, \text{head}_n) W^O \\ &\text{where } \space \text{head}_i = \text{A}(QW_i^O, KW_i^O, VW_i^O) \\ W^O & \in \mathbb{R}^{hd_v \times d_{\text{model}}} \end{aligned}
$$

## Group-Query Attention

by ([Ainslie et al., 2023](#bib-ainslie2023gqatraininggeneralizedmultiquery))

idea: reduce number of KV heads $n_k$ to a fraction $n_k^{'} = \frac{n_q}{k}$ of number of query heads $n_q$ (evenly dividing the query heads into $n_k$ groups with $r$ heads)

## RadixAttention

Implemented in ([Zheng et al., 2024](#bib-zheng2024sglangefficientexecutionstructured)) where they maintain a LRU eviction policy to maintain relevant [KV cache](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/Attention/../../thoughts/KV-compression) for all requests within a [radix tree](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/Attention/../../thoughts/Radix-tree)

radix tree setup:

- key: sequence of tokens
- value: KV cache tensor (stored in GPU in a paged layout)

_dynamic evolution of the radix tree in response to various requests._

> [!abstract]- explanation of RadixAttention with LRU eviction policy
>
> These requests include two chat sessions, a batch of few-shot learning inquiries, and a self-consistency sampling. Each tree edge carries a label denoting a substring or a sequence of tokens. The nodes are color-coded to reflect different states: green for newly added nodes, blue for cached nodes accessed during the time point, and red for nodes that have been evicted.

### cache-aware scheduling

We define the hit rate as

$$
\begin{aligned} \text{hit rate} &= \frac{\sum_{r \in R} \text{number of cached prefill tokens in } r}{\sum_{r \in R} \text{number of prefill tokens in } r} \\[8pt] &=1 - \frac{C}{\sum_{r \in R} \text{number of prefill tokens}} \end{aligned}
$$

_in batch settings: sort requests by matching prefix length and prioritise one with longer matched prefixes instead of FIFO schedule._

```pseudo
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Cache-Aware Scheduling for RadixAttention with Continuous Batching}
\begin{algorithmic}
\State \textbf{Input:} The radix tree $T$, the memory pool $P$, the current running batch $B$, the waiting queue $Q$.
\State \textbf{Output:} Finished requests and updated system state.
\State // Get all requests from the waiting queue
\State requests $\gets Q.\text{get\_all\_requests}()$
\State // Search for prefix matching for all waiting request
\For{req $\in$ requests}
 \State req.prefix\_node, req.prefix\_len $\gets$ T.match\_prefix(req.input\_tokens)
\EndFor
\State // Sort the request according to matched prefix lengths
\State requests.sort()
\State // Select requests for the next batch
\State available\_size $\gets$ T.evictable\_size() + P.available\_size()
\State current\_size $\gets$ 0
\State new\_batch $\gets$ []
\For{req $\in$ requests}
 \If{req.size() + current\_size $\le$ available\_size}
 \State new\_batch.append(req)
 \State $\delta \gets T.\text{increase\_ref\_counter}(req.\text{prefix\_node})$
 \State available\_size $\gets$ available\_size + $\delta$
 \EndIf
\EndFor
\State Q.remove\_requests(new\_batch)
\State // Insert requests into the current running batch
\State B.merge(new\_batch)
\State // Allocate new memory and do eviction if necessary
\State needed\_size $\gets$ B.needed\_size()
\State success, buffer $\gets$ P.alloc(needed\_size)
\If{$\neg \text{success}$}
 \State T.evict(needed\_size)
 \State success, buffer $\gets$ P.alloc(needed\_size)
\EndIf
\State B.run(buffer)
\State // Process finished requests
\State finished\_requests $\gets$ B.drop\_finished\_requests()
\For{req $\in$ finished\_requests}
 \State T.decrease\_ref\_counter(req.prefix\_node)
 \State T.insert(req)
\EndFor
\State \Return finished\_requests
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

We got lower bound:

$$
C \ge \sum_{e \in \text{edges}(T)} \mid e \mid
$$

Consider we visit radix tree $T$ in DFS order. For each edge $e$ of $T$, the first time we compute KV cache associated with $e$, then we will compute the whole subtree of $e$.

During computation of $e$ subtree, then edge $e$ will be continuously hit, thus no additional computation will happen.

> [!tip] cache hit
>
> with cache size $\ge$ maximum request length (which will equals to longest path in radix tree), edge $e$ **WILL NOT** be evicted during computation of its subtree since the common prefix including $e$ of the subtree will be continuously hit.

We can show that longest-shared-prefix-first order is equivalent to DFS order by induction [^proof]

### compressed FSM for jump-ahead tokens.

Implemented in ([Zheng et al., 2024](#bib-zheng2024sglangefficientexecutionstructured))

#### Method 1: [FSM](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/Attention/../../thoughts/constrained-decoding/../../thoughts/constrained-decoding#guided-generations-with-fsm)-based decoding

- intuition: Using FSM ([Willard & Louf, 2023](#bib-willard2023efficientguidedgenerationlarge)) to guide generations by increasing logit bias for tokens that conform to given JSON schema. This allows us to track the current state during decoding and filter out invalid tokens by applying logit bias to the output. ![](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/Attention/../../thoughts/constrained-decoding/../../thoughts/images/vllm/constrained-json-fsm.webp)

- limitation: we can see that given construction of FSM requires token-level access, it can only transition the state by only _one_ token at a time, resulting in slow decoding.

#### Method 2: Interleaved-based

- intuition: breaks down JSON schemas, each containing either a chunk prefill part or constrained decoding part. They are then executed interleaved by inference system. Faster than per-token decoding given that chunked prefill components can process multiple tokens per forward pass

  See also <https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance#guidance-acceleration> using llama.cpp as backend.

- limitation:

  - interleaved-based require custom syntax, making it less expressive compared to regex.
  - struggles to deal with tokenization boundaries due to conflicts between decode and chunked prefill segments.
  - frequent communications between interpreter and back-end adds additional overhead.

#### **_Method 3: Jump-Forward Decoding with compressed FSM_**

![](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/Attention/../../thoughts/constrained-decoding/../../thoughts/images/vllm/jump-forward-decoding-fsm.webp)

> [!tip] tokenization boundary handling
>
> During decoding, it is preferred to combine multiple characters into a single tokens.
>
> For example, when decoding `"Hello"` in context of JSON decoding, LLM might output the following token `"`, `He`, `llo`, `",`
>
> This may cause some strange behaviour if we combine the last `"` with `,` (this regex `"[\w\d\s]*"` with the last `,` will lead to endless decoding because this token `",` is not valid even if the LM wants to stop.)

Fix:

- implement _re-tokenization_ mechanism during jump-forward phase (append string instead of the tokens, followed with re-tokenization of the entire text) $\to$ add approximately 4% of overhead
- use a comprehensive regex to guide the decoding phase, instead of employing multiple concatenated regex

## Paged Attention

by ([Kwon et al., 2023](#bib-kwon2023efficient))

Used in conjunction with [continuous batching](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/Attention/../../thoughts/Continuous-batching), implemented through [vLLM](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/Attention/../../thoughts/vllm)

Reduce memory usage of attention mechanism by swapping kv-cache in and out of memory. A block manager is similar to those of _virtual memory_ in OS.

Essentially, it’s a form of **paging**, such that attention can be stored in contiguous memory. Partitions the KV cache of each sequence into KV blocks.

Another optimization is to use [KV compression](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/Attention/../../thoughts/KV-compression) to reduce the size of the KV cache for longer context.

Given:

- each block contains KV vectors for fixed number of tokens, denoted as block size $B$.
- Key block $K_j= (k_{(j-1)B+1}, \ldots, k_{jB})$
- Value block $V_j= (v_{(j-1)B+1}, \ldots, v_{jB})$

$$
A_{ij} = \frac{\exp(q_i^T K_j / \sqrt{d})}{\sum_{t=1}^{i//B} \exp(q_i^T K_t / \sqrt{d})}, \quad o_i = \sum_{j=1}^{i//B} V_j A_{ij}^T
$$

where $A_{ij}=(a_{i,(j-1)B+1}, \ldots a_{i,jB})$ is row vector of attention score on j-th KV block.

[^proof]: _base_: a random request correspond to node $x \in T$ will be processed.

    - All requests correspond to nodes $\{v_{1}, \ldots, v_{n}\}$ on path $x \gets \text{root}$ doesn’t need recomputation.
    - Thus, computation complexity for requests of nodes $\{v_{1}, \ldots, v_{n}, x\}$ is aligned with DFS

    _induction_: assume we visit node $y \in T$, and the visited node align with DFS order. Let $P$ denote _path of_ $y \gets \text{root}$.

    - Each node that has not been visited has the lowest common ancestor with visited nodes on $P$.
    - Since nodes on $P$ are cached, a node $z$ that has yet to be visited with lowest common accestor on $P$ will have the _longest shared prefix_
    - longest-shared-prefix-first order will select $z$, which is a valid DFS q.e.d
