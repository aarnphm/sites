([Friedman & Friedman, 1962](#bib-friedman1962capitalism))

### on occupational licensure

Three grounds for this arguments:

1. registration

2. certification

3. licensing proper

   - against fraudulent claims:

     > It goes still farther in the direction of trenching upon the rights of individuals to enter into voluntary contracts.

> The most obvious social cost is that anyone of these measures, whether it be registration, certification, or licensure, almost _inevitably becomes a tool_ in the hands of \[_a special producer group_] to obtain a **monopoly** position at the expense of the rest of the public.
