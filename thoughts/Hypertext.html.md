Coined by Ted Nelson around 1965, non-sequential text with free user movement, called **hypertext** in “Literary Machine”

> It is _non-sequential_ writing — text that branches and enable choices to readers, without the need to follow a predetermined path.

Hypertext can also be interpreted as a [database](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/Hypertext/../../thoughts/Database) format in which information related to that on a display can be accessed directly from the display

He also brought up the concept of transclusion, which include parts of documents within other documents by reference.

He envisioned an utopia, a global hypertext system (Xanadu) where all data was stored once, no deletions, and every information can be accessed through a links [^1], and everyone would be paid fairly for their work.
