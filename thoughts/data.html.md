For example: for link <relative_slug>../thoughts/KV-compression</relative_slug> within the content of slug <slug>thoughts/data</slug>, the target of would be <full_slug>https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/data/../thoughts/KV-compression</full_slug>

      result: <resolved_url>https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/Attention/../../thoughts/constrained-decoding/../../thoughts/constrained-decoding.html.md</resolved_url>
