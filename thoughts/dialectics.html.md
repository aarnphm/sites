### [Hegel](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/dialectics/../../thoughts/Hegel)’s dialectics

The opposing sides are dependant of the topics being discussed.

In [Phenomenology of Spirit](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/dialectics/../../thoughts/Hegel#phenomenology-of-spirit) which presents his [epistemology](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/dialectics/../../thoughts/Epistemology), the “opposing sides” are different definitions of consciousness and of the object that consciousness is aware of or claims to know.

In his work in [logic](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/dialectics/../../thoughts/logic), the opposing sides are logical concepts that are opposed to one another.
