## Engine

A search engine is essentially query processing. It is a form of [information retrieval](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/Search/../../thoughts/information-retrieval) that helps one to answer [questions](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/Search/../../thoughts/questions)

The search results are generally presented in a line of results, often referred to as search engine results pages (SERPs).

Some search engines also mine [data](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/Search/../../thoughts/data) available in databases or open directories. Unlike web directories, which are maintained only by human editors, search engines also maintain real-time information by running an algorithm on a web crawler.
