A constructive way to form communications with [LLMs](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/prompt-engineering/../../thoughts/LLMs). As we improve the quality of prompts, we can expect better results from the models. Similar to [linguistic](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/prompt-engineering/../../thoughts/linguistic), a good prompt is a good form of communication with the system.

This is different from [zero-shot prompting](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/prompt-engineering/../../thoughts/zero-shot-learning)

## CoT prompting

You can think of it as explaining a big topics to a five years old. You break down topic into smaller, logic parts that mimics a train of thoughts.

## Least-to-most prompting

Prompted to first list the sub-problems to a problem, then solve them in sequence.
